This repository contains the research and implementation details of the Master of Science thesis in Sustainable Management and Technology by Mathieu B√©langer, conducted at HEC ‚Äì University of Lausanne, IMD Lausanne, and √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Lausanne. The thesis, titled "Decentralizing Carbon Accountability: A Platform for User-Centric Blockchain Footprints and Offset," aims to address the environmental impact of blockchain technology through a novel approach to carbon emissions accounting and offsetting.

## Executive Summary

Blockchain technology, notably through its proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, has been criticized for high energy consumption and carbon emissions. This thesis proposes a user-level emissions accounting and offsetting platform, leveraging the transparency of blockchain data to attribute emissions based on user activity and enable carbon offsetting through the purchase of carbon credits.

## Thesis Structure

### Introduction

- Overview of blockchain technology and its environmental implications.
- Personal motivations and research questions that guide the thesis.

### Background and Previous Work

- Examination of blockchain sustainability, focusing on different consensus mechanisms and their environmental footprints.
- Literature review on carbon accounting methods applicable to blockchain technology.

### Methodology: Emission Attribution Model

- Development of a new model for attributing blockchain emissions at the user level.
- Comparison of this model with existing approaches using synthetic user data.

### Implementation: GreenBlock Platform

- Description of the GreenBlocks platform, a proof-of-concept tool developed to demonstrate the emission attribution model.
- The platform allows users to estimate their blockchain-related emissions and offset them by purchasing carbon credits.

### Discussion

- Analysis of the results obtained from the GreenBlocks platform.
- Exploration of the broader implications of user-level emissions accounting for blockchain sustainability.

### Conclusion

- Summary of findings and their implications for sustainable blockchain usage.
- Directions for future research in the field of blockchain sustainability and emissions offsetting.
